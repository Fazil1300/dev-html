I have learned anchor tag, referencing, some psuedo code

Hyperlink - used to link from one page to another.
<a>..</a>

href - attribute - indicates link's destination 
<a href="url">..</a>

An url can be
    abosolute url
    relative url

abosolute url - a full web address

relative url - a link to a page within the same website

mailto: with href attribute - create a link that opens the user's email program, To let them send a new email 

target attribute - specifies where to open the linked document
values
    _self - default - opens document in the same tab
    _blank - opens document in the new tab
   

psuedo class used
hover,active,visited

Things do not to do
    Avoid printing the full web address on the page
    Avloid "links to" phrase
    Keep your link short, Exact topic not sentences
    No links to say "click here"
