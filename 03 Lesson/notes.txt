I have learned basics of 
	creating text content on a web page
	nesting element
	block level elements

Web pages are like essays, newspaper having headings,paragraphs 
Very much of the headings are made up of headings and paragraphs element

Block Level Element
	Elements takes a full width from left to right as for as it.
	Elements it breaks a line and starts from new line.
