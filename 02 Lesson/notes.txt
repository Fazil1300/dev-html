In this I learned adding meta tags and attibutes in head section

meta element -> It defines metadata(extra information) of an HTML document.

attribute -> attributes are providing extra information about html element.
		always specified in the starting tag
		usually comes in name=value pair
			name="value"

link element -> It represents a relationship between the current document and
an external resource (CSS, JavaScript, Other resources pulling from web)

Added fav-icon
