I have learned about Forms and Inputs

An HTML form is used to collect user input.
The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

example
    contact form in web page

<form>...</form> - Form element is used to create an HTML form for user input.

<input> element is the most used form element.
<input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the "type" attribute.

action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

<label> - label element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.

Attribute
	type
		text
		radio
		checkbox
		submit
		reset
		password
		email 

	action
		get
		post

GET
	Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
	NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
	The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
	Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
	GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
POST
	Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
	POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
	Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

Attribute
value specifies an initial value for an input field.
readonly specifies that an input field is read-only.
maxlength specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in an input field.
required specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.
autofocus attribute specifies that an input field should automatically get focus when the page loads. first input only

	
label value should match with input(s) id value
name attribute will be used in server level


autofocus - only one element on a page can have autofocus
