I have learned about list elements

List Elements - allows to group a set of related items in lists.
we have three types of list to group lists
ordered list
unordered list
description list

Ordered list starts with <ol> and ends with </ol>
Unordered list starts with <ul> and ends with </ul>

Each list item starts with <li> and ends with </li>

Description list is list of terms, with a description of each items, description list starts with <dl> and endswith </dl>
<dt> tag defines term name
<dd> tag defines describes each term
